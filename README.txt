Library Inventory and Logging System

Overview
This Library Inventory and Logging System is a Python-based application. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing library operations efficiently, including book management, borrowing and returning books, logging visits, and tracking transactions. The system prioritizes data security through encryption, ensuring sensitive information stored within the system is protected.

Features
- Book Management:
  - Add, delete, edit, and view books in the library inventory.
  - Each book includes details such as title, author, date published, and status.
  
- Borrow and Return Books:
  - Borrow books from the library, marking them as unavailable.
  - Return borrowed books, marking them as available again.
  - Track borrowers and expected return dates.
  
- Logging:
  - Record visits to the library, including date, time, and purpose.
  - View all log entries to track library visits and activities.
  - View transactions per day to monitor library operations.
  
- Data Security:
  - Utilizes encryption for storing sensitive data such as book inventory, borrow list, and log entries.
  - Encryption keys are generated and managed securely.
